# karvonnen
add-on for the run app, using the Karvonnen HR method.

This app is an extra feature implementation for the Run.app of the bangle.js.
I would like to have it running in the run.app, as an extra screen, accessible by swipe right/swipe left.
The calculation of the Heart Rate Zones is based on the Karvonnen method. It requires to know maximum and minimum heart rates. More precise calculation methods require a lab.
Other methods are even more approximative.
Do copy, reuse, share the code, my only interest is to find help to have it running on Banglejs2 so that I can run with it :).
